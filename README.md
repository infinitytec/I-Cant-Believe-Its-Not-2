# I-Cant-Beleive-Its-Not-2
Userscript for Scratch 3.0. The goal of this is not to make Scratch 3.0 look exactly like Scratch 2.0, but rather ro make it look as similar as reasonably possible.

Used to make 3.0 look like 2, because why not?

I use Tampermonkey for installing userscripts. Get it at <https://tampermonkey.net/>.

Install: <https://github.com/infinitytec/I-Cant-Believe-Its-Not-2/raw/master/not2.user.js>

If you want to have blocks look more like Scratch 2's blocks, check out this userscript: <https://github.com/infinitytec/2.0-Colors>
## What will change?
A lot of it. The idea is to make 3.0 look as much like 2 as reasonably possible.
## What will stay the same?
Some 3.0 UI elements will work the exact same as in 3.0.
This includes the blocks palette and some UI buttons. I do not plan on changing these as it would require too much effort.
## Why?
For fun. And some people may want to use it.
